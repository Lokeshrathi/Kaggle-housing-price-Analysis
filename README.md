- Secured **Top 4% rank (1302) out of 39,000 competitors.**
- In this repo, I have tried to work on large scale data analysis. 

### Major steps included:

 - Understanding Data with 1460 rows and 80 columns, which has 1 dependent varialble (SalePrice).
 - The columns which attributed to the dependent variable.
 - Seperating the Categorical and Numeric data.
 - Finding outliers for Numerical data.
 - Removing columns with more than 96% same record both for Numerical/Cateogrical Data.
 - Removing columns with high multicollinearity, so that they dont affect our predictions further.
